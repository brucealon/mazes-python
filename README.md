# Mazes

This is just some code I was playing with to get comfortable with Python again after a few years away from the language, taken from the book Mazes for Programmers, by Jamis Buck.

## Execution

Simply run `./run.py` with Python 3.4+. No additional libraries are required.

## Testing

To run the tests:
```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest
```
